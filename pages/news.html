        <div class="nm_post_content"><p>If you're using one of my public proxy servers, you can ignore this message.</p>
            <p>But if you're self-hosting an fTelnetProxy installation, then you'll need to download the latest binaries from GitHub to fix a TLS issue.&nbsp; Firefox 74 has disabled TLS 1.0 and 1.1 by default, so this new fTelnetProxy release enables TLS 1.2 support to ensure Firefox users can still connect.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately this required upgrading to the .NET framework version 4.5, which means if you don't already have that version of the framework installed you'll have to install it first.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Which also unfortunately means XP is no longer supported, because as far as I know XP does not have an install for .NET 4.5.&nbsp; So if you're using XP either stick to the old version and turn off https when serving the fTelnet client, or switch from self-hosted to one of my public proxies.</p>
