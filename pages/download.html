<h2>Download options</h2>

<div class="well">There are now multiple ways to download and install the client on your website. I've listed them below from easiest to most difficult to setup.</div>

<h3>Run the embedded version</h3>
<div class="well">
    The newest and easiest method for running the client no longer involves downloading anything to your computer and/or web server.&nbsp; Just head on over to the embed wizard and answer a few questions, then paste the javascript snippet onto your page, and you're done.&nbsp; And you'll always be up to date -- if I add a new feature to the client and/or proxy, you'll automatically get the new feature.<br>
    <br>
    The embedded version is hosted on GitHub and cached by CloudFlare, so it has pretty awesome uptime, and the proxies are hosted with very reliable VPS providers, so also have pretty amazing uptimes.<br>

<h3>Run the embedded client, self-host the proxy</h3>
<div class="well">
    Already running (or want to setup) a proxy on your own server?&nbsp; Then you can always use the embedded client and configure it to connect to your own proxy server.&nbsp; This should improve latency because your proxy and telnet servers will be much closer together than my public proxy and your telnet server are likely to be.<br>
    <br>
    When running the embed wizard, just put in the hostname and port of your proxy (not the hostname and port of your telnet server) and select the <strong>I run my own proxy</strong> option.&nbsp; Then when you setup your proxy, that's where you'll specify your telnet server's hostname and port.<br>

<h3>Self-host the client, use the public proxy</h3>
<div class="well">
    If you'd like to customize the appearance of the client in any way but don't want to go through the hassle of setting up a proxy, then this is the option for you. Just download and install the client and set it up to use a public proxy using one of the servers listed below.<br>

<h3>Self-host everything</h3>

    If you've read the previous descriptions, it should be pretty obvious how this is going to work.<br>
